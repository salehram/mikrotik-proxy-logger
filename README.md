# Mikrotik Proxy Logger

This software is aiming to fulfill all the requirements from such application, I have seen many applications like this, but each one is having a major disadvantage, such as limited in reporting functionality, or being cache based software (meaning you need to MANUALLY import the logs from the Mikrotik device EVERYDAY), or being a Linux dependent only, or also being a central application, where it can only be ran from one location everytime…

The idea of this software will try to fix all the above (and many other) issues, so we will have:

* Plenty of options in reports generation and flexibility in report conditions.
* Will capture all incoming logs and put them in the database in real-time,
* You can install this application anywhere on the network… as it will come in 2 parts, a service to capture and store the data, and a GUI to read and generate the reports.
