for accounting data:
- we will calculate the user usage over the period we select
- we will calculate the over all usage for all usres in the period we select then we will calculate the selected user percentage






- NOTE: requests going to the accounting URL will not be logged in the database.
-----------
features to be added:
- most used protocols (http, ftp...)
- most used content type (jpeg, exe, zip...)
- a new service to handle report generation based on selected time schedules
- a regex function to analyze the requested URLs and store the main parts of the domain string, so we can use this to calculate the most visited domains
